"""RTL8821AU (DKMS) M6: TX descriptor builder — vendor port.

Ports `rtl8812a_fill_fake_txdesc` [SRC] rtl8812a_xmit.c:265 — the vendor's minimal,
self-contained "send this frame directly" descriptor. That field set is exactly what
monitor-mode injection needs: one non-aggregated, unencrypted frame at a fixed low
rate, HW-assigned sequence number. wifit3 uses it for every injected frame:

  * deauth / fake-auth / assoc — management frames (SEC_TYPE = 0).
  * WEP ARP replay — the captured ARP is ALREADY WEP-encrypted, so it is re-injected
    raw with SEC_TYPE = 0 (no HW re-encryption) on the same path. The vendor's
    `bDataFrame` SEC_TYPE branch never applies here, so one descriptor serves both.

This is NOT the full `update_txdesc` (rate adaptation, aggregation, HW security, RTS).
The 40-byte size, the SET_TX_DESC_*_8812 field bit positions, and the XOR-16 checksum
are identical to the rtl8814au_dkms sibling; the 8812a additionally sets FIRST_SEG and
OWN (the sibling omitted them — both are correct for a single-segment frame, and the
vendor sets them), so they are ported here.
